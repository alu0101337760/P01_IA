#Github repository: https://github.com/alu0101337760/P01_IA.git

#Description of the files:

    +The unity project folder is P01_UnityProjects, it contains all of the assets and unity libraries
     alongside the source code of the project.

    +The Build folder contains the built project with the .exe to run the project.

    +The source code for the algorithm is located in P01_UnityProject/Assets/Scripts/pathfindingAlgorithm
     but there are multiple other scripts located in the rest of the folders contained in /P01_UnityProject/Assets

    +To run the program execute Build/P01_UnityProject.exe, it should work on linux but it has only been tested on windows 10.

#Instructions for the program:

    +Use WASD to move the camera and mouse wheel to zoom in/out.

    +You can place obstacles manually by clicking on the plane after you've stated a width and height
     and pressing the "Add obst" button.

    +You can select the ammount of obstacles you want to randomly spawn with the slider on top of the 
         "Generate Random Obstacles" button.

    +If you wish to change any of the pathfinding parameters or obstacles after already simulating once, you must
     press the simulate button again for them to take effect.
